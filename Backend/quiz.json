  "feedback": "{\"1-8\":\"You most commonly adopt an authoritarian or autocratic leadership style. You rarely consult your team members and, instead, tend to tell them what you want, when you want it, and how you want it done.\\n This style works well in a crisis, when a task must be completed quickly. However, you will likely demoralize, demotivate and aggravate people if you use it all the time. This can translate into high absenteeism and turnover rates. You will also miss out on a wealth of ideas, thereby stifling innovation and creativity.\",\"9-16\":\"You lean toward a democratic or participative style of leadership. You tend to set the parameters for the work and have the final say on decisions, but you actively involve your team members in the process.\\n This style can build trust between you and your people, as they will likely feel engaged and valued. But it is not great in a high-pressure situation that requires a fast turnaround, as it will slow you down. And, if you dislike disagreement or conflict, you might struggle with how people respond to consultation.\",\"17-25\":\"Your default leadership style is probably delegating or laissez faire. You give your team members free rein in how they work toward their goals.\\n This is an ideal approach when your people are highly skilled and motivated, and when you're working with contractors and freelancers who you trust. But if a team member is inexperienced or untrustworthy, or if you lose sight of what's going on, this approach can backfire catastrophically.\"}",
