## Project Overview

A self-reflection online platform for young people with lived experiences from disadvantaged backgrounds. More information can be found in the [project background](./docs/ProjectBackground.pdf).

## Demo

## Features

**Sprint 1**

For sprint 1, we plan to focus on developing the functionality for LECs  to take quizzes. The user should be able to complete the entire workflow as an LEC, meaning he/she can choose which quiz to take, select the  answers to each quiz, check and edit previous answers, see feedback, and write user experience comments.

The organized user stories in sprint 1 are: US01, US02, US03, US04, US08, US09, US10, US11



**Sprint 2**

For sprint 2, we plan to focus on developing the functionality for  Supervisors to create and manage quizzes, as well as ensuring that LECs  can view the quizzes they have taken. The supervisor should be able to  complete the entire workflow as a supervisor, meaning he/she can create  the quiz, set the quiz public or private, edit the quiz, delete the  quiz, view the feedback and user experience of LECs who chose to share  with them. 

The organized user stories in sprint 2 are: US05, US06, US07, US12, US13, US14, US15, US16, US17, US18, US19, US20, US21
